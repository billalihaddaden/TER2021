Two images are said to be similar if they are similar semantically or visually. For a human, it is easy to judge the similarity between images. However, to define exactly the notion of similarity is too complicated. However, similarity is very important in many applications such as image-based search engines. For this project we will focus purely on visual similarity without taking semantics into account. We will initially focus on style transfer and image generation, using modern neural network architectures such as VAE, AdaIN, DST*, pix2pix, CycleGan, StyleGan... The goal of this project is to generate images that share a strong visual similarity but are semantically different.
